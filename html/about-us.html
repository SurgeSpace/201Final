        <div class="side back"><p>Josiah Green is a person who loves to get out and have an adventure. When he isn’t coding he is out cycling, hiking, or camping, and when it’s extra wet and cold out he likes to just stay in and work on his art or crack open a video game. Creation and exploration are necessities for happiness and coding is both those things. You can tell a computer to create just about anything in a multitude of different ways, and that’s pretty dang cool.</p>

        <div class="side back"><p>Jeremy is a business guy posing as a programmer because he understands the value of the ability to communicate with devs, and decided doing an immersive coding program was the best way to bridge that gap. Prior to Code Fellows, he worked at an AI startup, earned an MBA at the University of Washington, and served in the U.S. Army. Jeremy enjoys snowboarding, hiking, backpacking, and coding.</p>
